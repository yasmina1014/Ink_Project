# The Prince and the Painted Lion
->Intro

It is late at night and the King is working on completeing his duties as King before retiring for the night. Finializing taxes, passing bills, and preparing a banquet for the arrival of his 1st born son. But, he is very tired.

Should he:

+Go to sleep. ->Sleep Early

+Finish his Kingly duties. ->Sleep Late

->Sleep Early
The King sleeps soundly until when he hears shouting and commontion in the palace. He wakes up and rushes outside to see what all the commotion was about and found the people rioting right outside the palace walls. ->End

->Sleep Late
The King completes all of his tasks and finially retires for the night (even though it's well into the wee hours). But, the King had a terrible dream that his son would be killed by a lion. He woke up in a sweat and due to his paranoia and need to protect his child, he ordered the palace servants to build a massive wall surrounding the palace and ordered that his son may never leave these walls. ->Continue

As the years went on, the young Prince lived in complete bliss never questioning what lied beyond the castle walls until the young boy turned 18. The boy's curiosity fueled his imagination of the outside world and he began reading tales in the royal library and soon became restless to want to see this place that held so many adventures in the pages of the books that he has read in the confinds of his castle.
One day, the Prince was having lunch with his father and durring their meal, the Prince stated, "You know dad, the world isn't as scary as you make it up to be."
"Son, you know why you are to stay in the palace-"
"I know father, but still there are so many people out there who are exposed to the outside world everyday and they seems fine-"
"THIS CONVERSATION IS OVER!"
The Prince sat back with shock, then that shock turned into anger, "Fine!"
The Prince stood up and left the room in a storm.
As the Prince strolled across the edges of the wall, that were filled with paintings as the years went on, he ran across a painting of a lion. The prince stopped in his tracks and stared at the painting of the lion. Anger soon enraged him and he punched the wall, "You are the reason why I'm stuck in here!" As tears began to run down the Prince's face, he had to make a choice to change his own destiny.

+Order the royal guard to slay the beast for him. ->Royal Guard

+Slay the beast himself. ->Himself

->Royal Guard
After wiping the tears away, the Prince made his way to the royal guard and ordered them to slay the beast that keeps him locked in the palace and the royal guard polietly obliged. A teamm was gathered up to slay the lion and soon were off on their conquest. Just a mere few weeks later, word got back that the beast had been slain but at the cost of a few of the men that was on the team. The Prince was overjoyed to finially be able to leave the palace but had to go to the families of the deceased soliders and pay his respects to them as well as help their families pay their monthly bills as well as donate food from the palace every so often. The Prince is filled with joy to finially go outside the palace walls but he now lives with the guilt and question of, "At what cost though?" ->End
->Himself
After wiping the tears away and only having pure rage left within him, the prince stormed off to find a weapon of some sort to use to slay the beast himself. But, he wanted to do it secretly, he didn't want his father to know because then his father would do anything in his power to prevent him from slaying the beast himself. So he could not simply go to the royal guard's weaponry. There was only one place where he knew he could find a weapon and have nobody suspect him and that was, the thorned tree. When the Prince arrived at the thorned tree, he tried reaching for a thorn to pull it from the tree's trunk but ended up slashing his hand open. From the loss of blood and the posion from the tree that got into the Prince's blood, the Prince fell deathly ill and soon died a few days later. ->End
